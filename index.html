			  Dress is an important feature of all human societies.. In addition to the obvious function of providing protection and warmth, dress serves many other purposes, most of them having to do with communicating our identity to others. Indeed protection and warmth may not have been the earliest purpose of dress.

When it comes to finding a dress to wear on a night out, the options are endless. Certain outfits flatter certain body types, weather and occasions, so it can be overwhelming to try and tackle the choices alone.

It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length and can be formal or casual. The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty, weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer.
Perhaps the most obvious function of dress is to provide warmth and protection. Many scholars believe, however, that the first crude garments and ornaments worn by humans were designed not for utilitarian but for religious or ritual purposes. Other basic functions of dress include identifying the wearer (by providing information about sex, age, occupation, or other characteristics) and making the wearer appear more attractive. Although it is clear why such uses of dress developed and remain significant, it can often be difficult to determine how they are achieved. Some garments thought of as beautiful offer no protection whatsoever and may in fact even injure the wearer. Items that definitely identify one wearer can lose their meaning in another time and place. Clothes that are deemed handsome in one period are declared downright ugly in the next, and even uniforms—the simplest and most easily identified costume—are subject to change. What are the reasons for such changes? Why do people replace garments before they are worn out? In short, why does fashion, as opposed to mere dress, exist?

There are no simple answers to such questions, of course, and any one reason is influenced by a multitude of others, but certainly one of the most prevalent theories is that fashion evolved in conjunction with capitalism and the development of modern socioeconomic classes. Thus, in relatively static societies with limited movement between classes, as in many parts of Asia until modern times or in Europe before the Middle Ages, styles did not undergo a pattern of change. In contrast, when lower classes have the ability to copy upper classes, the upper classes quickly instigate fashion changes that demonstrate their authority and high position. During the 20th century, for example, improved communication and manufacturing technology enabled new styles to trickle down from the elite to the masses at ever faster speeds, with the result that fashion change accelerated.

Furthermore, the idea that fashion is a reflection of wealth and prestige can be used to explain the popularity of many styles throughout costume history. For example, royal courts have been a major source of fashion in the West, where clothes that are difficult to obtain and expensive to maintain have frequently been at the forefront of fashion. Ruffs, for example, required servants to reset them with hot irons and starch every day and so were not generally worn by ordinary folk. As such garments become easier to buy and care for, they lose their exclusivity and hence much of their appeal. For the same reason, when fabrics or materials are rare or costly, styles that require them in excessive, extravagant amounts become particularly fashionable—as can be seen in the 16th-century vogue for slashing outer garments to reveal a second layer of luxurious fabric underneath.


Similarly, it has been thought that impractical fashions demonstrate that the wearer does not need to work, and indeed would find it difficult to do so. Examples include the Chinese practice of binding women’s feet, making it difficult for the women to walk far. Yet this did not prevent working-class Chinese families from binding their daughters’ feet. In Europe, corsets were worn not only by aristocratic women but also by middle-class and working-class women. Contrary to popular belief, 19th-century women’s clothing does not prove that a woman’s husband or father could afford to hire servants to work for her. Men have also worn their share of impractical apparel; notable examples include the necktie and the high, powdered wig.

The foregoing discussion does not attempt to be a comprehensive introduction to even one influence on fashion; it merely tries to suggest some of the ways in which costume can be analyzed and interpreted. Similar treatments of four other factors affecting fashion follow.


Display of the human physique

Male display

Male sexual display at its most blatant can be seen in parts of Papua New Guinea, where the men wear penis sheaths (usually made from a dried gourd) that may be 15 inches long or in some cases even longer. The purpose is to impress both women and enemies, by showing that the warriors are more virile than their opponents. The competition between warriors has led to a great variety of additional adornments such as boars’ tusks, animal skins, animal teeth, claws, feathers, shells, metal pieces, bamboo, and the use of paint. In general, the more naked a society is, the more body paint, tattoos, or scarification is employed to denote the warriors and the chiefs, with each rank having its individual pattern. In addition, in many societies, only after an individual has reached a certain age or satisfied some other requirements is he allowed to wear certain colours or decorations. Sometimes each item of adornment represents a specific achievement, so that the more decorations a man wears, the better, braver, or more powerful he is shown to be.

Martial display in Europe reached its apex with the tournaments of the Middle Ages. The participants spent fortunes on enameled armour, ostrich plumes, pearl-embroidered tabards, ornate saddles and horsecloths, fine mounts, a retinue of grooms and squires, weapons, tents, and other materials. It was a formalized kind of warfare, and foreign ambassadors were invited to be impressed by the martial display of the king or prince. An audience of women was also essential, as they had to confer favours on the knights, and the lady of the tournament had to present the bejeweled prize to the overall victor.

In terms of its blatant attempt to draw attention to the phallus, the European codpiece was analogous to the penis sheath of New Guinea. During the 14th century men started shortening their tunics until they reached the crotch. A special pouch, the codpiece, had to be created to fill in the gap between the hose, as the latter comprised a pair of individual cloth tubes—one for each leg—that tied directly to a belt at the waist. Initially the codpiece was not padded, but it grew larger until by the 1540s the Spanish were wearing a vertical, or erect, codpiece. This style—and its spread to other parts of Europe—may be seen to be a reflection of Spain’s new dominance in the Western world and its new wealth.

A covered-up look dominated male attire from the 17th until the late 18th century, when the Neoclassical movement led to tighter, more revealing clothes. Skin-coloured knee breeches in buckskin became the rage, and waistcoats shrank, so that from the waist downward the male form was again on show. A naked style affected the army too; uniforms became skintight, and the male form was displayed most obviously in the Napoleonic period. Under Queen Victoria the frock coat concealed all such shocking elements as legs, waist, and genitals, which remained concealed until after World War II, when skintight jeans became the means for a renewal of male sexual display. By the 1990s, Lycra had entered at least some men’s wardrobes in the form of leisure wear, its clinging characteristics providing even more extreme “naked” outlines. Thus, since the 14th century in the West, the degree of exposure of the male body has alternated between total concealment and complete display.

Female display

Views on female display have also changed dramatically. In “primitive” societies living in hot climates, almost total nudity was acceptable for both sexes. However, with the rise of Christianity, and 600 years later of Islam, covering of the female form became compulsory. Meant to simultaneously demonstrate and inculcate modesty, both religions exhorted women to be clothed from head to foot. St. Paul wrote to Timothy “that women should adorn themselves modestly and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire but by good deeds, as befits women who profess religion.” St. Peter expressed similar views, and St. Augustine of Hippo censured makeup as well, although he allowed that a woman might adorn herself slightly to please her husband if the practice was carried out in private. Traditions of modest dress are expressed today in the apparel worn by women who are conservative Muslims or members of “plain” Christian groups such as the Amish and Mennonites.

From 381, when Theodosius I made Christianity compulsory in the Roman Empire, Christian views on modesty dominated women’s apparel. These views not only mandated the covering of the body and hair but also maintained that the fabric and fasteners of the covering itself should be modest. Later, Diocletian divided the Roman Empire into two parts, and Constantine I the Great founded another capital, Constantinople. Eastern Rome on the Bosporus adopted the Eastern taste for coloured and patterned fabrics, and after 552, when the emperor Justinian I established the first silk-manufacturing industry in Europe in Constantinople, the city became renowned for its luxurious silks and brocades.

Meanwhile, western Rome suffered barbarian invasions and centuries of disorder until it broke up into separate kingdoms. Once these new courts had established themselves, they, too, started trying to outdress and outshine one another. The Anglo-Saxons, for example, wore loose clothes, but after the Norman Conquest (1066) members of the court started wearing tighter-fitting clothes. This was achieved by cutting the garments on the bias and lacing them under the arm, with the result that the female figure in particular was outlined very obviously. Although abbots and bishops objected vehemently, the new fashion for displaying the physique continued unabashed. This style, which also featured exaggerated cuffs reaching the ground, dominated the 1100s. By the 1340s necklines had become so wide that they were almost off the shoulder. Moreover, the adoption of buttonholes from the Moors around 1250 had introduced the art of tailoring. Clothes could now be cut very tight and still be easily removed. Shaped seams evolved, and the possession of a shapely figure was essential for both men and women. By 1400 women’s waistlines were higher, emphasizing the bosom and making the differences between the sexes obvious. The exposure of the female neck became almost permanent in court circles thenceforth.

It was not until the end of the 18th century, when Neoclassical taste came to the fore, that the exposure of the female form was again a major issue. When the English novelist Fanny Burney visited Paris in April 1802, her modest wardrobe was found too full: “Three petticoats! no one wears more than one! Stays? everybody has left off even corsets! Shift-sleeves? not a soul now wears even a chemise.” In an homage to the styles of Classical Greece and Rome, women adopted high-waisted, diaphanous gowns.

With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, a more covered-up style developed. But the Victorians were not as prudish as people think. Crinolines revealed the ankles, and corsets emphasized female curves. Evening dresses had very low necklines. The narrower skirts of the 1870s and 1880s allowed the outline of a woman’s legs to be seen.

Also influential in the late 19th century was the vogue for women’s sports, and some freer clothes evolved in consequence. Amelia Bloomer’s reformed trousers (“bloomers”) for women did not become fashionable, but they were adopted by women gymnasts, sea bathers, and cyclists. Shorter skirts were designed for walking, golfing, shooting, and tennis.

The acceptance of less cumbersome costumes for sports affected swimwear, and, once the designer Coco Chanel made suntans the rage, exposure of the female form became almost total. Sunbathing suits revealed more of the female anatomy than any costume since antiquity: whereas in the past ladies had gone to great lengths to avoid being browned by the sun (for a sunburned complexion was the mark of a peasant), there was an almost universal vogue for sun worship in the West from the 1920s until the 1980s, when heavy sun exposure began to be warned against, with doctors stressing the dangers of skin cancer. The backless evening dresses of the 1920s and ’30s required a suntan to display and in cut were practically bathing costumes with skirts. The 1950s launched the bikini, which provided minimal coverage for women and was followed by the acceptance of even total nudity on some designated beaches.
